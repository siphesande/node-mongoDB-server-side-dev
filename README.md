# node-mongoDB-server-side-dev
This repo deals with all things server-side. I base the entire repo around the NodeJS platform. I start with a brief overview of the Web protocols: HTTP and HTTPS. We examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for building web servers. On the database side, we review basic CRUD operations, NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS. I examine the REST concepts and building a RESTful API. We touch upon authentication and security. Finally I review backend as a service (BaaS) approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services.
